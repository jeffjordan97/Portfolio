        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I've always been driven by curiosity and a love for solving complex
          problems, which naturally led me to a career in software engineering.
          Over the past 5+ years, I've had the privilege of working on a wide
          range of projects, from full-stack applications to large-scale system
          integrations. With expertise in Java, Angular, and cloud technologies,
          I specialize in designing, developing, and deploying efficient,
          scalable software solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I've learned that being a software engineer
          isn't just about mastering a single technology—it's about having a
          broad toolkit of frameworks, languages, and platforms to draw from.
          Having the ability to choose and apply the right tools for the job is
          key. My experience across a wide range of technologies allows me to
          approach each project with flexibility, selecting the most efficient
          and scalable technologies based on the specific challenges at hand.
